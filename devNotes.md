Creating a well-structured template app with a Flutter frontend and a Rust backend using GraphQL is a great approach to building scalable and maintainable software. Hereâ€™s a high-level plan to get your template app up and running:

### 1. **Project Structure and Setup**
- **Repository Setup:** Maintain a single repository with two main folders: `frontend` for Flutter and `backend` for Rust. This setup helps in version controlling both parts of the application together.
- **Version Control:** Initialize a Git repository if not already done. Consider including a `.gitignore` file for both Rust and Flutter to avoid committing build files and dependencies.

### 2. **Flutter Frontend Setup**
- **Create Flutter Project:** Run `flutter create frontend` within the `frontend` directory. This sets up the basic Flutter project structure.
- **Setup Routing and Authentication Screens:** Implement screens for user registration and login. Also, set up routing to navigate to the home screen after login.
- **GraphQL Client:** Integrate a GraphQL client in Flutter (e.g., `graphql_flutter`) for communicating with your Rust backend.
- **Authentication State Management:** Use a state management solution (like Provider, Bloc, or Riverpod) to handle user authentication states across the app.

### 3. **Rust Backend Setup**
- **Create Rust Project:** Initialize a Rust project in the `backend` folder using `cargo new backend`.
- **GraphQL API with Rust:** Choose a GraphQL library (such as `async-graphql`) and set up a basic GraphQL server. Define schemas and resolvers for user registration and login functionalities.
- **Database Integration:** Integrate a database solution suitable for your needs (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB). Implement database models and operations required for user management.
- **Serverless Deployment:** Prepare the Rust application for serverless deployment. Package it in a container if using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Run.

### 4. **Authentication Integration**
- **Choose an Authentication Provider:** Decide between Firebase, Auth0, or another similar service for managing user authentication.
- **Integrate Authentication in Rust:** Implement authentication logic in your Rust backend to handle user registration and login using JWTs.
- **Secure GraphQL Endpoints:** Ensure that GraphQL endpoints require authentication, and use middleware in Rust to validate the JWT tokens.

### 5. **Deployment and Testing**
- **Local Testing:** Test the entire application locally. Ensure that the frontend communicates effectively with the backend via GraphQL, and that user authentication flows work as expected.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy your Rust backend to the cloud. Configure the deployment to automatically scale and manage the application.
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment:** Set up CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment processes.

### 6. **Documentation**
- **README.md:** Document the project structure, setup instructions, and usage in the `README.md` file. Include details about each part of the project and any environment configurations needed.

### 7. **Future Extensibility**
- **Modular Design:** Design both frontend and backend to be modular. This allows easy addition of new features as you fork the repository for new projects.
- **API Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation for your GraphQL API to make it easier to understand and extend in future projects.

This high-level plan provides a structured approach to building your template app, ensuring it's scalable, maintainable, and ready for future enhancements.

## Installation Notes

I successfully completed step 1 (Project Structure and Setup). I installed Flutter, but needed to install the `adb` command with apt-get. I received a few errors when checking the Flutter install with `Flutter doctor`. So I installed Android Studio. I also needed to install the SDK Manager, but the tools install a Windows batch file that cannot be run by bash.


The Flutter configuration under WSL continues to be problematic. I am thinking that maybe I will move away from Flutter and into some other framework, maybe React, Vue, or Svelt. I may give Flutter one more try by having dual installations of Android Studio. I would only end up using the Windows installation if I ever build for native Android.
